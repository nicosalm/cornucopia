# Cornucopia
HackUIowa 2023 - Winner, Best Agricultural Innovation by John Deere

## Our mission
Food insecurity is a problem, and access to nutrient rich produce has become challenging. We want to develop a robust framework for neighborhood gardners and small-scale farmers to collaborate. Cornucopia has a vision to enable local farmers to seamlessly connect and contribute to their community, bringing fresh food and good health to their neighbors.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Leverages React.js to seamlessly render components with dynamic states and TailWind.css to design a minimalistic template. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
